Hello, thanks for checking out my project! In this project, I decided to give webscraping a go (I had never done it before). I webscraped information on raleigh houses available for rent from apartments.com and created a personalized, interactive dashboard. I hope you enjoy!



Scripts:
contains 3 .py files
    WebScrape_apartments.py : webscrapes house info and preprocessing data
    locateHousing.py : finds lat and long of each house, calcs distances, etc
    dashboard.py :builds the dashboard

Data:
contains 4 .xlsx files and 1 .html file
Note: none of this is downloaded data, each file is created in the code files to store data
    Housing_map.html : folium map of the houses
    HousingInfo.xlsx : data on houses
    HousingSpecifics.xlsx : data on the amenities/policies/specifics of each house
    links.xlsx : links to each house listings webpage
    SpecificsSet.xlsx : (not important) set of all the amenities/policies/specifics mentioned in the listings
